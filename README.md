# Mealy Sequence Detector (1010 without Overlap)
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Mealy state machine-based sequence detector designed to recognize the pattern "1010" without overlap in an input sequence. This project provides a clear example of how to design and implement a Mealy finite state machine (FSM) for sequential pattern detection.

## Overview
A Mealy state machine is a type of finite state machine where the outputs are dependent on both the current state and the current input. In this project, we've implemented a Mealy state machine to detect the sequence "1010" in an input stream. The detector recognizes the sequence without allowing for overlap, meaning that once the "1010" sequence is detected, it won't immediately recognize it again until another "1" is encountered.
